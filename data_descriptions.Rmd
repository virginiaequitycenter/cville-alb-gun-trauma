The data listed below represent information that is publicly and readily available online. This document is meant to serve as an overview of the existing resources so that we can begin representing the nature, shape, and dimensions of the problem locally.

All of this data is administrative and made up of information created when people interact with public services. As a result, we need to remember the deeply human aspect of this data. Granted personal info is scrubbed from this report, we should keep in mind that these are people and members of our community that we are talking about.

### Gun Violence Archive

The national [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) describes gun violence as:

> "all incidents of death or injury or threat with firearms... Violence is defined without intent or consequence as a consideration. To that end a shooting of a victim by a subject/suspect is considered gun violence as is a defensive use or an officer involved shooting. The act itself, no matter the reason is violent in nature."

This database includes information collected from public news sources about 201 incidents of gun violence in the Charlottesville/Albemarle region from May 2014 - Feb 2024. The incidents range from shots fired reports, to unlawful gun ownership, to acts of violence such as assault, suicide, and homicide.

Because the data is sourced from public news websites, if an act of violence didn't receive local news attention it was not included in the Gun Violence Archive database. That means this data underrepresents some information, especially shots fired numbers. Notably, it looks like shots fired incidents haven't been added to the database since 2021.

The data is made up of two dataframes: one has information about each incident and the associated outcome variables (for example, the number of people injured and/or killed), and the other lists the participant-level information (for example, the age rage and gender of the participants for both victims and suspects. The data includes the geocoded location and date of each incident and the characteristics of each incident (for example, injury, homicide, or shots fired). The data does not give any information about the race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or mental health status of any of the participants.

```{r gva_incidents, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

gva_incidents <- read_csv("data/gva_incidents.csv") %>%
  clean_names() 

gva_incidents %>%
  group_by(yr = year(incident_date)) %>%
  summarise(total_injured = sum(victims_injured + suspects_injured),
            total_killed = sum(victims_killed + suspects_killed)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_longer(matches("total")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = yr, y = value, fill = name)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Victim Status",
                      breaks = c("total_injured", "total_killed"),
                      labels = c("Injured", "Killed")) +
  labs(title = "Victims of Gun Violence in the Charlottesville/Albemarle Region",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Victims") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35))
```

#### Individual-level data

```{r gva_participants, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

gva_participants <- read_csv("data/gva_participants.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(-operations, -participant_name, -city_or_county, -state) %>%
  mutate(incident_date = (mdy(incident_date)))

reactable(gva_participants)

```

### Charlottesville Open Data Portal

The [Charlottesville Open Data Portal](https://opendata.charlottesville.org/datasets/charlottesville::crime-data/about) includes over 500 crime reports in City of Charlottesville from March 2019 through April 2014. As defined by the Charlottesville Police Department, a crime report "represents the initial information that is provided by individuals calling for police assistance." The data is maintained by CPD and updated nightly. The dataset includes the time of a call, the type of incident, the geocoded location of the incident, and the reporting officer.

This is not a definitive collection of public safety data for Charlottesville. We should consider the factors that influence the inclination of an individual calling the police. Are there systematic reasons that someone might call the police more or less than someone else? It's also significant to note that just because a call was made, does not mean that an arrest was made. All individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

Because there is not a comparable portal, this dataset is limited to incidents that occur within city limits. It does not include Albemarle County Police or UVA Police information.
